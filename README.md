## Note:

- <a href="https://kutt.it">Kutt.it</a> API permits **50** URLs shortening per day using the API Key.
- **Enable Custom Host** option to use with self-hosted kutt
  - Save the self hosted domain in the input (eg: https://mykutt.it)
    - **Note**: the api endpoint is automatically appended during the api call.
- _Delay at times while shortening might be the issue with Kutt.it API and not with the extension's._
